### Model Training
The model has been trained on ... paintings using the <a href="https://github.com/cs-chan/ArtGAN/tree/master/WikiArt%20Dataset" target="_blank">Wiki Art Dataset</a>. The model beat the state-of-the-art result that was obtained by the creators of the dataset, which can be found in their academic paper <a href = "http://web.fsktm.um.edu.my/~cschan/doc/ICIP2016.pdf">Ceci nâ€™est pas une pipe: A Deep Convolutional Network for Fine-art Paintings Classification</a> by WR Tan et al.(2017).

this model reached  accuracy(%) in style classification while WR tan et al. CNN-finetune model reached 54.50%
